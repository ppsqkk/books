Recursive version:
factorial is bound to a procedure object in the global environment.
Calling (factorial 6) means resolving factorial to the procedure object,
creating a frame with the global environment as its enclosing
environment, binding n to 6 within that frame, and then actually
performing the factorial procedure. Performing (factorial 6) involves
performing (factorial 5), so we create another frame with the global
environment as its enclosing environment, bind n to 5 within that frame,
and then perform the factorial procedure again. In total, we will have 6
frames for n in {1..6}, each enclosed by the global environment.

Iterative version:
factorial and fact-iter are bound to procedure objects in the global
environment. Calling (factorial 6) involves the same steps as in the
recursive version. This time, (factorial 6) calls out to fact-iter, and
fact-iter is called 7 times, for a total of 8 frames enclosed by the
global environment.
