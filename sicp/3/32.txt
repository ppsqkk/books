Suppose we have:

(define a (make-wire))
(define b (make-wire))
(define c (make-wire))
(set-signal! a 0)
(set-signal! b 1)
(and-gate a b c)

Then, (set-signal! a 1) will add an action procedure which sets c to 1,
and (set-signal! b 0) will add an action procedure which sets c to 0. If
we used a regular list instead of a queue, c would be set to 0 first,
then to 1.
