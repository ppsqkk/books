Calling make-account creates a frame pointing to the global environment.
Call that frame I. Procedure objects for withdraw, deposit, and dispatch
are created in frame I, and acc is bound to the dispatch procedure
object in the global environment. Calling acc creates a frame pointing
to I, and the procedures returned from calling acc (withdraw and
deposit) also create frames pointing I. I is where the local state is
stored.

Only the global environment is shared between acc and acc2.
