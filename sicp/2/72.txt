For the most frequent symbol, we check if it is part of the symbol list
of the left branch, which has n - 1 symbols. Therefore, the order of
growth of time is O(n).

For the least frequent symbol, we check the symbol lists of all left
branches in the tree. The order of growth of time is about O(n^2).
