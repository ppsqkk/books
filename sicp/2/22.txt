First question:
If items is (1 2 3 4), answer will successively contain:
()
(1)
(4 1)
(9 4 1)
(16 9 4 1)
This is because cons adds to the front of the list. Therefore, the last element
in items will be added to the front of the list.

Second question:
This doesn't create a list, because (square (car things)) is never a list.
