She is correct: par2 is the "better" program. As noted in exercise 2.14,
par2 assumes that (div-interval r1 r1) is the same as
(make-interval 1 1), which is correct. The same variable, divided by
itself, should always yield 1, even if the value of the variable is
uncertain. On the other hand, if two distinct variables which happen
to have the same intervals are divided, the answer is not necessarily 1.
