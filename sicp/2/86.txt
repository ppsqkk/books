Write-up for 86.scm

We would like the parts of a complex number (real part, imaginary part,
magnitude, angle) to be tagged data. The actual complex package does not
determine representation, so we need to modify the rectangular and polar
packages.

Since we are using tagged data, we need to replace all primitive scheme
procedures with generic procedures working on tagged data. Specifically,
we need to replace square, sqrt, sin, cos, and atan. It really only
makes sense to implement these for real numbers; due to the raising
procedure we wrote in Exercise 8.24, however, they will also work for
types lower in the tower. As always, we need to make sure that the names
of the new generic procedures do not shadow the primitive procedures.

We replace primitive procedures in the complex package in exactly the
same way.

We need to change the project procedure for complex numbers as well.
Essentially, for a complex number z, we want to convert (real-part z)
into a real number. Assuming that (real-part z) is lower in the tower
than a real number, we can achieve this conversion with (add ((get 'make
'real) 0) (real-part z)). (This introduces the perhaps unwanted
restriction that any part of a complex number can only be as high as a
real number in the tower.)

Finally, we need to change the way that a real number is raised to a
complex number. Specifically, we need to tag both the real and imaginary
parts.
