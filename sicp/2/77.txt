(magnitude z)
(apply (get 'magnitude '(complex)) (map contents z))
; (get 'magnitude '(complex)) is exactly the generic magnitude selector.
; (map contents z) looks like '(rectangular 3 .4)
; The 'complex tag is stripped off and magnitude is called recursively.

(magnitude '(rectangular 3 . 4))
(apply (get 'magnitude '(rectangular))
       (map contents '(rectangular 3 . 4)))
; (get 'magnitude '(rectangular)) is the magnitude defined inside
; install-rectangular-package.
; (map contents '(rectangular 3 . 4)) looks like '(3 . 4)
; The 'rectangular tag is stripped off and the contents are sent to the
; rectangular-specific magnitude.
