See 2.14 and 2.15 for the first part of this question. The task is
impossible because interval arithmetic and regular arithmetic
operate under different rules. It is probably possible to improve
interval arithmetic, provided there is some way to distinguish
between equivalent variables and equivalent values (see 2.15). For
example, (div-interval x x) should be equivalent to
(make-interval 1 1), but (div-interval x y) should be calculated as
shown in subsection 2.1.4.
