a.
(define (get-record employee file)
  (let ((proc (get 'get-record (list (type-tag file)))))
    (proc employee (contents file))))

The personnel file should contain a tag corresponding to the division.
For example, the tag for the personnel files of the first division could
be 'division-1-file. Additionally, the division needs to have installed
their own get-record procedure into a global table, for example with the
call (put 'get-record '(division-1-file) <procedure>) for the first
division.

We don't use apply-generic here because employee is an untagged string.

b.
(define (get-salary record)
  (apply-generic 'get-salary record))

Records need to be tagged corresponding to the division. The tag should
be different for files and records, so as to distinguish the two. For
example, the tag for the records of the first division could be
'division-1-record. Additionally, the division needs to have installed
their own get-salary procedure into a global table, for example with the
call (put 'get-salary '(division-1-record) <procedure>) for the first
division.

c.
(define (find-employee-record employee file-list)
  (if (null? file-list)
      false
      (let ((r (get-record employee (car file-list))))
        (if (equal? r false)
            (find-employee-record employee (cdr file-list))
            r))))

This requires that all division-specific get-record procedures return false if
the record is not in the file.
